# U-Boot
A simple game

This is a simple game in which you gain score by destroying
submarines with bombs dropped from a ship.

The game is implemented in Python using the library PyGame.

The game is currently in English (except for the title “U-Boot”,
which is German for “submarine”), but I eventually want to add
internationalization.

See file dependencies.txt to see what Python and library versions
I've tested it. Later versions should probably work, too. Earlier
versions may or may not work. Note that some early 2.x versions
of PyGame had broken mp3 support on Linux; this game won't run
unter Linux with those versions.

I've used some artwork files from others. All of them are either
public domain or under a Creative Commons license. Please see
file non_original_files.txt for details.
