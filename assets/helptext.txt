GAME MECHANICS

You are controlling the bomb release of a ship that moves on the surface from left to right. The ship looks like this: @img assets/schiff.png@

Pressing the down arrow key releases a bomb if available. It appears below the ship and sinks at constant speed.

A bomb explodes on hitting a submarine and destroys it, giving you score. In rare cases, two bombs may destroy one submarine, or one bomb may destroy two submarines at once. Submarines look like this: @img assets/Uboot.png@

A bomb may also destroy a whale instead of a submarine. Destroying a whale does not give you score. A whale looks like this: @img assets/whale.png@

In each level you must destroy a minimal number of submarines.



SCORING

Dropping a bomb while another bomb is still active costs some score. That cost goes up with the number of currently active bombs. The number of currently available bombs is limited by the condition that the score must never get negative.

For each destroyed submarine your score increases. That increase is the larger the deeper the submarine was. Note that the score is per submarine, not per exploded bomb.

Note that this implies that your score may go down as well as up.



STATUS DISPLAY

On the top of the window, there are several status displays.

On the left, you'll find the two lines (with changing numbers):

Bombs: 100 (1 available)
Bomb cost: 0

The first line tells you how many bombs you have left in total, and how many of them are currently available given your score. If no bombs are currently available, this line turns red.

The second line tells you how much score dropping one more bomb will currently cost you. Note that the first bomb is always free.



STATUS DISPLAY (continued)

On the right, you'll find the two lines (again with varying numbers):

Level: 1, Score: 0
Remaining submarimes: 30/50

The first line gives you your current level and score.

The second line tells you how many submarines you still need to destroy to clear the level, and how many submarines are still to come (including those currently on the screen). When the latter is 0, the level ends.

When the first number is zero, the line turns green, indicating that the level will be cleared. When the second number goes below the first, the line turns red, indicating that you won't be able to clear this level.
